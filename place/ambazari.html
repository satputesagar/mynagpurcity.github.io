                   <p> Ambazari lake is situated near the Southwest border of Nagpur, in the state of Maharashtra, India. It is one of the 11 lakes in Nagpur and is the largest lake in the city. The Nag River of Nagpur originates from this lake. This was built in the year 1870, under Bhonsle rule, for supplying water to the city. Government officials and eminent people were supplied water through clay pipes. This lake is near VNIT and surrounded by mango trees, gaining the name Ambazari as "Amba" means "mango" in Marathi.</p>
                   <p>The lake was used to supply water to Nagpur for over 30 years. Due to pollution, it is not currently used as a water supply.</p>
