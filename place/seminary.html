                   A local favourite, Seminary Hill is a small hillock located about 6 kms away from the city of Nagpur. The hillock gets its name from the seminary of St. Charles. From the top of Seminary Hill, one can get an awe inspiring view of Nagpur. Apart from these, the Japanese garden at its foot is one of the main attractions of this place. It is also home to the S.F.S. College. The Lourd Mata Church or Grotto of Our Lady is also located on the plains of Seminary Hill. Telankhedi Hanuman Temple and Satpura Botanical Garden are two other attractions of this hillock.
               </p>
                   <p> Government bodies like the offices of Air Force, CGO Complex and TV Tower are also situated in this beautiful spot. As you can see, Seminary Hill is an independent tourist hub in itself! Often described as the lungs of Nagpur, Seminary Hill is a sea of green and the controlled wilderness offers amazing walkways for morning walkers and joggers.</p>
